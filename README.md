# API Project: URL Shortener Microservice for freeCodeCamp


### User Stories

1. I can POST a URL and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response. For example `{"original_url":"https://www.google.com","short_url":"bNiTo-IUF"}`
2. If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http(s)://www.example.com(/more/routes)` format, the JSON response will contain an error like `{"error":"invalid URL"}`.
3. When I visit the shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
